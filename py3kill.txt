Unify vdbbin and vivbin

Move workspace events over to a enum
Maybe just redo notifier entirely

`__init__.py`:
test addLibraryDependency
test getLibraryDependency
addRelocation does not obey file defs


test getSymByAddr
Fix fixmes in getSymByAddr
test getSymHint

makeFunction -- remove meta

getXrefsTo -- burn fixme and make xrefs use MapLookup

implement delMemoryMap
implement VWE_DELMMAP


getLocation doesn't use the range parameter

test PE/petool.py and add features

add better iterator for vs version info stuff

test the things in bits

who uses radixtree?

# FIXME: use getBytesDef (and implement a dummy wrapper in VTrace for getBytesDef)

vivisect/cli.py
do_symboliks --> actually use watchaddr


RIP OUT ENVI/CONFIG

symcache.py -- symCacheHashFromElf -- implement
            -- check input path
            -- line 102 implement HTTP proxy and revsync proxy for symbols


change out prints to logging

CobraAsync need not be a thing since py3.7 has async
If they want up to date cobra, mandate >=py3.7?
remove the whole "verbose" thing
change urllib2 to requests

import imp --> import importlib
* also api change

We shouldn't just silently swallow TypeErrors in visgraph
is visgraph still valid in the face of networkx?

delfunction fixme

addLocalEnums and directly smushing things onto locals is evil

qtwebkit is dead. long live qtwebenginewidgets

imp is dead. long long importlib

pickle must die

so the i386 and amd64 package structure is quite possibly screwed. Need to get rid of the whole circular import
structure we've got going on

test getRegisterIndex == getRegisterOffset


There's this horrible little pattern in the envi modules where the Archmod depends on the Emulator and 
the emulator depends on the archmod, creating this circular chain of dependencies that makes importing this
super fine tapdance of "will it work? LET'S FIND OUT"
* We can break this since down the line, IMemory doesn't care and only use _arch_id (requires changing the Emulator base class a little bit

vivisect.tools.graphutils has a lot of unused variables that need to be used/implemented
